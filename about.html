<h2>About "Joy of Elixir"</h2>

<p>
  Joy of Elixir came about because I saw that there was not very much when it comes to absolute beginner material for learning Elixir. It seemed like there is a vast, empty, <em>cavernous void</em> where there should be something like the excellent <a href='https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/'>Learn to Program book by Chris Pine</a>. We have people completely new to programming <em>wanting</em> to learn Elixir, but the support is not-quite-there yet. So this is an attempt to fill that void.
</p>

<p>
  I want Joy of Elixir to stand on its own as the go-to-resource for teaching people programming <em>for the very first time</em> using Elixir. I want them to experience the <em>joy</em> that Elixir (and programming in general) can bring to people. I want them to feel like they have power over the machine because of the knowledge contained within this book.
</p>

<p><strong><em>I want them to feel competent as our future's computer programmers. Anyone can become a programmer.</em></strong></p>

  <p>
    The book is currently very much a work-in-progress and I'm sure there will be people out there who <a href='https://github.com/joyofelixir/joyofelixir'>can submit feedback</a> on how to improve it. If you find any mistakes, please do submit an issue over on the GitHub repository.

<h2>Who did this?</h2>

<p>
  Somebody who cares deeply about teaching beginners how to program. Names are not important here. The work can stand on its own.
