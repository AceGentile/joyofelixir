    <p>
      The book is currently very much a work-in-progress and I'm sure there will be people out there who <a href='https://github.com/radar/joyofelixir'>can submit feedback</a> on how to improve it. If you find any mistakes, please do submit an issue over on the GitHub repository, letting us know what chapter you saw the mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't want to submit it there, a quick email to <a href='mailto:errata@joyofelixir.com'>errata@joyofelixir.com</a> will work just as well.

  <p>
    Joy of Elixir came about because I saw that there was not very much when it comes to absolute beginner material for learning Elixir. There's the excellent <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html'>Getting Started guide on elixir-lang.org</a> and the <a href='https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3'>Programming Elixir</a> book, but those feel like they're more targeted towards experienced programmers.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seemed like there is a vast, empty, <em>cavernous void</em> where there should be something like the excellent <a href='https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/'>Learn to Program book by Chris Pine</a>. That book is for another programming language called <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org'>Ruby</a>; but there feels like there should be an equivalent to that for Elixir.
  </p>

  <p>
  We have people completely new to programming <em>wanting</em> to learn Elixir -- because people who have learned Elixir already told them about it and how cool it is! -- but the support is not-quite-there yet. So this is an attempt to fill that void. Essentially a response to: <em>"Why won't <u>somebody</u> think of the newbies?"</em>. Well, someone <em>is</em> thinking of the newbies.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want Joy of Elixir to be the go-to-resource for teaching people programming <em>for the very first time</em> using Elixir. I want them to experience the <em>joy</em> that Elixir (and programming in general) can bring to people. I want them to feel like they have power over the machine because of the knowledge contained within this book.
  </p>

  <p><strong><em>I want them to feel competent as our future's potential computer programmers. I want them to feel like anyone can become a programmer.</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Who did this?</h2>

    <p>
      The Joy of Elixir project was started by <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/'>Ryan Bigg</a> (that's me). I love teaching people about programming and I wanted to write something to teach programming-first-timers about programming. Elixir is a great first language to use as it is simple to learn -- especially if you have a good book leading the way!
