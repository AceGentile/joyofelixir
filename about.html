<h2>About "Joy of Elixir"</h2>

<p>
  Joy of Elixir came about because I saw that there was not very much when it comes to absolute beginner material for learning Elixir. There's the excellent <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html'>Getting Started guide on elixir-lang.org</a> and the <a href='https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3'>Programming Elixir</a> book, but those feel like they're more targeted towards experienced programmers.
</p>

<p>
  It seemed like there is a vast, empty, <em>cavernous void</em> where there should be something like the excellent <a href='https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/'>Learn to Program book by Chris Pine</a>. We have people completely new to programming <em>wanting</em> to learn Elixir, but the support is not-quite-there yet. So this is an attempt to fill that void. Essentially a response to: <em>"Why won't <u>somebody</u> think of the newbies?"</em>. Well, someone <em>is</em> thinking of the newbies.
</p>

<p>
  I want Joy of Elixir to stand on its own as the go-to-resource for teaching people programming <em>for the very first time</em> using Elixir. I want them to experience the <em>joy</em> that Elixir (and programming in general) can bring to people. I want them to feel like they have power over the machine because of the knowledge contained within this book.
</p>

<p><strong><em>I want them to feel competent as our future's potential computer programmers. I want them to feel like anyone can become a programmer.</em></strong></p>

  <p>
    The book is currently very much a work-in-progress and I'm sure there will be people out there who <a href='https://github.com/joyofelixir/joyofelixir'>can submit feedback</a> on how to improve it. If you find any mistakes, please do submit an issue over on the GitHub repository.

<h2>Who did this?</h2>

<p>
  Somebody who cares deeply about teaching beginners how to program. Names are not important here. The work can stand on its own. I've not done much work to mask my identity and I'm sure you can work it out if you're determined enough.
