<h2>Built-in functions: lists, maps and more</h2>

<h3>Working with lists</h3>

<p>
  We looked earlier at how we could reverse a string, but how about if we wanted to reverse something else, like this list?
</p>

<pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

<p>
  We wouldn't reach into the <code>String</code> drawer to work with a <em>list</em>, because strings are not lists and lists are not strings! Just like we wouldn't reach into the top drawer in your kitchen to pull out the milk: it's in the fridge, silly!
</p>

<p>
  We should reach into the <code>List</code> drawer instead, right? Let's try that:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/1 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"])</span></code></pre>

<p>
  Uh oh, there's that red text again. The computer is telling us that Elixir doesn't know about a function called <code>List.reverse</code>, or the function is "<em>private</em>". The computer (slyly) won't tell us which one of non-existence or privateness it is, but we'll assume the first case here: that the function is undefined.
</p>

<aside>
  <header>Roberto asks: "Hey, what's that <code>/1</code> after the function?"</header>

  <p>
    Glad you asked! It's indicating the <em>arity</em> of the function. Elixir functions can not only differ by <em>name</em> but also by the number of arguments that the function takes. This error message is telling us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function, and if we passed two arguments instead of one it would tell us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/2</code> function instead.
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/2 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"], [1, 2, 3])</span></code></pre>

<p>A good example of this is the <code>String.split</code> function that we saw earlier. It has two variants, one that takes a single argument (<code>String.split/1</code>) and one that takes two arguments (<code>String.split/2</code>). We only saw the single-argument version before:</p>

<pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!")
[<span class='console-green'>"Hello,"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"World!"</span>]</code></pre>

<p>
  However, if we supply a second argument to this function it behaves differently:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!", "o")
["Hell", ", W", "rld!"]</code></pre>

<p>
  The second argument to <code>String.split/2</code> tells the computer where to split the string. With the single argument version, the computer assumed we wanted to split on the spaces between the words. With the two argument version -- that is, the <code>/2</code> version -- we tell it that we want to split on the <code>"o"</code> character instead.
</p>

<p>
  At this point it's also worth mentioning that the <code>String.reverse</code> function we called earlier has a proper name of <code>String.reverse/1</code>. Just like <code>/2</code> indicates the function takes two arguments, the <code>/1</code> here indicates that this function takes one argument.
</p>

<p>
  This is an important distinction to make in Elixir, and so I'll say it again, this time a bit bigger:
</p>

<p style='font-size: 150%; text-align: center;'><strong>Functions not only differ by name, but by the number of arguments that they take.</strong></p>
</aside>

<p>
  Ok, so we've talked about what <code>/1</code> means (Roberto is now deep in thought), so let's talk about why <code>List.reverse/1</code> doesn't exist.
</p>

<h3>Thank you Reader, but our <s>princess</s> function is in another <s>castle</s> module</h3>

<h4>Another brief interlude, this time about enumerables</h4>

<p>
  Lists are a type of data in Elixir called an <em>enumerable</em>. Maps are also <em>enumerable</em>. This means that they can be <em>enumerated</em> through, and you can do something which each item in the list or map. For instance, if we were to write out our list on a piece of paper, it might look something like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cat</li>
  <li>Dog</li>
  <li>Cow</li>
  <li>Turducken</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It's possible to write each item from the list separately from the other items in the list. We could try to do the same thing for a number (like 1,354), but it wouldn't make sense:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>5</li>
  <li>4</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Numbers are not enumerable because it doesn't make sense for them to be, unlike our list. We can go through each of this list of animals one-at-a-time if we wish. Similar to this, we could <em>enumerate</em> through a map. If we were to take one of our maps from earlier...
</p>

<pre><code>%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}</code></pre>

<p>
  ...and write each key and value pair down, they may look something like this:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt><dd>Roberto</dd>
  <dt><strong>Age</strong></dt><dd>30ish</dd>
  <dt><strong>Gender</strong></dt><dd>Male</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Again, it makes sense for a map to be an enumerable because you can <em>enumerate</em> through each of the key and value pairs in the map.
</p>

<h4>Ok, but where is <code>List.reverse/1</code>?</h4>

<p>
  We need to keep in mind that when we're working with <em>enumerable</em> things in Elixir the function that we need might live elsewhere. Sometimes, we need to look in the <code>Enum</code> module / drawer too. <code>Enum</code> is short for <code>Enumerable</code>, and it's done that way because nobody has the time to write out <code>Enumerable</code> correctly every single time. Even as this book's author I have a hard time spelling it correctly each time!
</p>

<p>
  We tried looking in the <code>List</code> module to find the <code>reverse/1</code> function so that we could turn our list around but it wasn't there. So let's look in the <code>Enum</code> module instead. Before that, let's get our list in Elixir form again. It's been a while since we've seen it that way:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

<p>
  Since we now know that lists are <em>enumerables</em>, and that the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function doesn't exist <em>but</em> we also (now) know that there's an <code>Enum</code> module to work with this sort of thing, we can probably guess that there's going to be an <code>Enum.reverse/1</code> function. Let's try it and see:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
[<span class='console-green'>"turducken"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cow"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"dog"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cat"</span>]</code></pre>

<p>
  Hooray! We were able to reverse our list.
</p>

<aside>
  <header>That function <em>might</em> be in the Enum module instead</header>
  <p>
    <small>(I thought I would put this in an aside so it's more visible. I know it's not a traditional aside, but it's an important concept and needs highlighting. So with the actual aside-ing out of the way:)</small>
  </p>

  <p>
    It's important to keep in mind that when we're working with enumerable objects such as lists and maps that we might not be able to find the function in the <code>List</code> or <code>Map</code> modules because the function might be inside the <code>Enum</code> module instead. If you can't find it where you think it might be, make sure you remember to look at <code>Enum</code> too!
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
  Roberto emerges from his deep thought trance to ask another question: "Hey, you mentioned before you could <em>enumerate</em> through a list or a map, but you didn't show an example of that. What gives?" You're absolutely right, Roberto. I was too distracted with explaining why <code>List.reverse/1</code> didn't exist to explain how to enumerate through an enumerable. Let's all now take a look at how to do that before we move onto other functions. We've talked about enums briefly and it would be a shame to stop so early.
</p>


<h3>Enumerating the enumerables</h3>

<p>
  To appease Roberto (and the masses that he leads), we're going to need to look at how to enumerate through enumerables. What this means is that we're going to get an enumerable (a list or a map) and we're going to go through each of the enumerable's items and do something with them.
</p>

<p>
  Let's start with a list. How about a list of the seasons, just for something different?
</p>

<pre><code>iex> seasons = ["summer", "fall", "winter", "spring"]</code></pre>

<p>
  The simplest way of enumerating through a list in Elixir is to use the <code>Enum.each</code> function. This function takes two arguments: the thing we want to enumerate through and a function to run for each of the items. Let's take a look at an example:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.each(seasons, &amp;IO.puts/1)</code></pre>

<p>
  The first argument here is our list of seasons. The second argument is the function that we want to run for each element in this list: specifically the built-in <code>IO.puts/1</code> function.
</p>

<div class='todo'>
  Finish explaining Enum.each
</div>














<h4>Map, but not the kind that you know already</h4>

<p>
  The names of these seasons should be capitalized because they are nouns, but whoever created this list neglected to capitalize them. Oops! What we should have is a list with proper capitalization:
</p>

<pre><code>["Summer", "Fall", "Winter", "Spring"]</code></pre>

<p>
  What we want to do in this case is to enumerate through each item in the list and to capitalize the first letter of each word, leaving all the others as lower case. There's a function to do this called <code>String.capitalize/1</code>, and for a single string we can call it like this:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> String.capitalize("summer")
<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span></code></pre>

<p>
  "But how do we run that function on each item in a list?", Roberto asks. He then cries: "I don't want to have to rewrite the whole list!" Roberto is being a little dramatic &mdash; given it is a small list of four items &mdash; but I can see his point. We <em>could</em> rewrite the list to make it what we want it to be, but we're <em>computer programmers</em>, so let's program the computer to do our bidding instead.
</p>

<p>
  We're going to need a function that goes through each item in the list and applies <code>String.capitalize/1</code>; something that would turn our existing list into a list like this one:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> seasons = [
  String.capitalize("summer"),
  String.capitalize("fall"),
  String.capitalize("winter"),
  String.capitalize("spring"),
]
[<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Fall"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Winter"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Spring"</span>]</code></pre>

<p>
  But since we've already got a list we're going to have to do <em>something</em> to that list to turn it into what we want. That something is to use another function from the <code>Enum</code> module called <code>Enum.map/2</code>. This <code>map</code> function is different from the map kind of data (<code>%{"name" => "Roberto"}</code>), in that it will take the specified enumerable and function, enumerate through each item in the list and run that function for each item, and then return the result.
</p>

<p>
  Enough jibber-jabber. Let's see this in actual practice:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.map(seasons, &amp;String.capitalize/1)
[<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Fall"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Winter"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Spring"</span>]</code></pre>

<p>
  Hooray! Each of our seasons now has a correctly capitalized name. What's happened here is that we've told the <code>map</code> function that we want it to run another function -- that'd be the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function -- on each item of the <code>seasons</code> list. This is how we've been able to go from our existing list with non-capitalized season names to a new list with capitalized names.
</p>

<h3>Working with maps</h3>

<p>
  Now that we've looked at enumerating through lists, let's look at enumerating through maps. We spoke a little while ago about doing so:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Similar to this, we could <em>enumerate</em> through a map. If we were to take one of our maps from earlier...
  </p>

<pre><code>%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}</code></pre>

  <p>
    ...and write each key and value pair down, they may look something like this:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt><dd>Roberto</dd>
    <dt><strong>Age</strong></dt><dd>30ish</dd>
    <dt><strong>Gender</strong></dt><dd>Male</dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
  To enumerate through each item in the map we can use the same function as when we were enumerating through each item in a list: <code>Enum.each/2</code>. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre><code>iex> person = %{"name" => "Roberto", "age" => "30ish", "gender" => "Male"}
%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}
iex> Enum.each(person, fn ({k, v}) -> IO.puts v end)
</code></pre>

<p>
  Before I can go any further, Roberto interrupts. "Hey, those curly braces are weird! It looks like a map but it's not a map. And it's not a list because the curliness of the brackets. So what is it?"
</p>



* Explain enumerating through maps here, showing that kv pairs are returned as tuples.
* Explain what tuples are and how they differ from lists. (iirc, tuples cannot be appended to or iterated (or can they?))
