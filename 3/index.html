<h2>Making lists</h2>

But what <em>else</em> can Elixir do? We've seen that it can handle strings and it can handle mathematical equations with ease, but what else? Well, what if we had a <em>list</em> of things that we wanted the computer to remember? And we wanted the computer to remember them in a particular order?

We could do this by assigning each of the things to a unique variable:

<pre><code>iex(11)> first = "fish"
<span class='console-green'>"fish"</span>
iex(12)> second = "ham"
<span class='console-green'>"ham"</span>
iex(13)> third = "eggs"
<span class='console-green'>"eggs"</span></code></pre>

<p>
  But then we would need to remember that the things we want are stored in the variables <code>first</code>, <code>second</code> and <code>third</code>. And what if we -- as humans -- forget what position we were up to?
</p>

<pre><code>iex(14)> fifth = "bread"
<span class='console-green'>"bread"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
  <em>Disasterous!</em> This simply won't do.
</p>

<p>
  A better solution to getting the computer to remember a list in Elixir is to actually tell it what we're storing is a list. To do this, we wrap our list in square brackets (<code>[]</code>) and separate each item in the list with a comma:
</p>

<pre><code>iex(15)> shopping_list = ["fish", "ham", "eggs", "bread"]
[<span class='console-green'>"fish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"ham"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"eggs"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"bread"</span>]</code></pre>

<p>
  The computer will now remember our entire shopping list in one variable, rather than remembering it across multiple variables. Now we have a one-stop-shop that we can go to for our shopping list.
