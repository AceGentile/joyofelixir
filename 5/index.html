<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>

<div class='todo'>
  Work in progress.

  Will need to cover pattern matching, particularly that <code>=</code> is not assignment, + demonstrating how to pull values out of a map.

  This should chapter should probably also cover <code>case</code>.
</div>

<p>
  Back in <a href='/2'>Chapter 2</a> you saw that the equals sign (<code>=</code>) made the computer remember things.
</p>

<pre><code>iex(6)> sentence = "A really long and complex sentence we'd rather not repeat."
<span class='console-green'>"A really long and complex sentence we'd rather not repeat."</span>
iex(7)> score = 2 / 5 * 100
<span class='console-yellow'>40</span></code></pre>

<p>
  While this is indeed still true, the equals sign (<code>=</code>) can do more than just set one value at a time. There's a hidden feature of Elixir that we haven't shown yet, and that feature is called <em>pattern matching</em>. The equals sign isn't just about assigning things to make the computer remember them, but it can also be used for <em>matching</em> things.
