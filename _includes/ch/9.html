  <h3>Working with lists</h3>

  <p>
    Just like there is a <code>String</code> module for working with strings, there is also a <code>List</code> module for working with lists. This module includes functions like <code>first</code> that will tell you what the first item in a list is:
  </p>

<pre><code>List.first([1, 2, 3, 4])
<span class='console-yellow'>1</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    And it also lets you figure out what the last item is too:
  </p>

<pre><code>List.last([1, 2, 3, 4])
<span class='console-yellow'>4</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    We looked earlier at how we could reverse a string, but how about if we wanted to reverse something else, like this list?
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    We would think that just like <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> that there should be a <code>reverse</code> too! Let's try it out:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/1 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"])</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Uh oh, there's that red text again. It seems like that this function doesn't exist, even though we thought it did. We are lacking the superpower of being able to will functions into being at this current point in time, so we'll have to do some sleuthing to figure out why it's missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The computer is telling us that Elixir doesn't know about a function called <code>List.reverse</code>, or the function is "<em>private</em>". The computer (slyly) won't tell us which one of non-existence or privateness it is, but we'll assume the first case here: that the function is undefined. (We'll come back to private functions a little later on in the book.)
  </p>

  <aside>
    <header>Roberto asks: "Hey, what's that <code>/1</code> after the function?"</header>

    <p>
      Glad you asked! It's indicating the <em>arity</em> of the function. We saw the word <em>arity</em> back in Chapter 5, and to refresh your memory, arity is another way of saying "the number of arguments".
    </p>

    <p>
      Elixir functions can not only differ by <em>name</em> but also by the number of arguments that the function takes. This error message is telling us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function. It's showing the <code>/1</code> at the end because we only passed one argument. If we passed two arguments instead of one it would tell us that we tried to call the <code>List.reverse/2</code> function instead.
    </p>

<pre><code>iex> List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
List.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals, [1, 2, 3])
<span class='console-red'>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function List.reverse/2 is undefined or private
    (elixir) List.reverse(["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"], [1, 2, 3])</span></code></pre>

  <p>A good example of this is the <code>String.split</code> function that we saw earlier. It has two variants, one that takes a single argument (<code>String.split/1</code>) and one that takes two arguments (<code>String.split/2</code>). We only saw the single-argument version before:</p>

<pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!")
[<span class='console-green'>"Hello,"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"World!"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    However, if we supply a second argument to this function it behaves differently:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> String.split("Hello, World!", "o")
["Hell", ", W", "rld!"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    The second argument to <code>String.split/2</code> tells the computer where to split the string. With the single argument version, the computer assumed we wanted to split on the spaces between the words. With the two argument version -- that is, the <code>/2</code> version -- we tell it that we want to split on the <code>"o"</code> character instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point it's also worth mentioning that the <code>String.capitalize</code> function we used back in the last chapter has a proper name of <code>String.capitalize/1</code>. Just like <code>/2</code> indicates the function takes two arguments, the <code>/1</code> here indicates that this function takes one argument. When referring to Elixir functions, make sure to include the arity as well as the function's name.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an important distinction to make in Elixir, and so I'll say it again, this time a bit bigger:
  </p>

  <p style='font-size: 150%; text-align: center;'><strong>Functions not only differ by name, but also by the number of arguments that they take.</strong></p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    Ok, so we've talked about what <code>/1</code> means (Roberto is now deep in thought), so let's talk about why <code>List.reverse/1</code> doesn't exist.
  </p>

  <h3>Thank you Reader, but our <s>princess</s> function is in another <s>castle</s> module</h3>

  <p>
    The short version of why the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function doesn't exist is because it lives in a separate module; it exists in the <code>Enum</code> module. The name <code>Enum</code> is short for <code>Enumerable</code>, and it's done that way because nobody has the time to write out <code>Enumerable</code> correctly every single time. Even as this book's author I have a hard time spelling it correctly each time! Thank goodness for autocomplete.
  </p>

  <p>
    "What on earth is an enumerable?", Roberto cries out. Hold your horses, Roberto. We're getting to that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lists are a type of data in Elixir called an <em>enumerable</em>. Maps are also <em>enumerables</em>. This means that they can be <em>enumerated</em> through; which means that you can do something which each item in the enumerable object (a list or a map). For instance, if we were to write out our list on a piece of paper, it might look something like this:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cow</li>
    <li>Turducken</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's possible to write each item from the list separately from the other items in the list. Because we're able to do this we can safely say that this list is <em>enumerable</em>. We could try to do the same thing for a number (like 1,354), but it wouldn't make sense:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>5</li>
    <li>4</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Numbers are not enumerable because it doesn't make sense for them to be written like this, unlike our list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similar to this, we could <em>enumerate</em> through a map. If we were to take one of our maps from earlier...
  </p>

<pre><code>%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}</code></pre>

  <p>
    ...and write each key and value pair down, they may look something like this:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt><dd>Roberto</dd>
    <dt><strong>Age</strong></dt><dd>30ish</dd>
    <dt><strong>Gender</strong></dt><dd>Male</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    Again, it makes sense for a map to be an enumerable because you can <em>enumerate</em> through each of the key and value pairs in the map.
  </p>

  <h4>And now for the big reveal</h4>

  <p>
    We need to keep in mind that when we're working with <em>enumerable</em> things in Elixir the function that we need might live elsewhere. Sometimes, we need to look in the <code>Enum</code> module / drawer too.
  </p>

  <p>
    We tried looking in the <code>List</code> module to find the <code>reverse/1</code> function so that we could turn our list around but it wasn't there. We found out a short while ago that the function is actually within the <code>Enum</code> module, so let's try using that function. Before that, let's get our list in Elixir form again. It's been a while since we've seen it that way:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> animals_or_derivatives_of_animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "turducken"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Since we now know that lists are <em>enumerables</em>, and that the <code>List.reverse/1</code> function doesn't exist <em>but</em> we also (now) know that there's an <code>Enum</code> module to work with this sort of thing, we can probably guess that there's going to be an <code>Enum.reverse/1</code> function. Let's try it and see:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.reverse(animals_or_derivatives_of_animals)
  [<span class='console-green'>"turducken"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cow"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"dog"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"cat"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Hooray! We were able to reverse our list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Roberto's features relax from intense concentration to a more neutral setting and he asks, "Hey, you mentioned before you could <em>enumerate</em> through a list or a map, but you didn't show an example of that. What gives?" You're absolutely right, Roberto. I was too distracted with explaining why <code>List.reverse/1</code> didn't exist to explain how to enumerate through an enumerable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's all now take a look at how to do that before we move onto other functions. We've talked about enums briefly and it would be a shame to stop so early when you can do so much more with them than reverse them.
  </p>


  <h3>Enumerating the enumerables</h3>

  <p>
    To appease Roberto (and the masses that he leads) yet again, we're going to need to look at how to enumerate through enumerables. What this means is that we're going to get an enumerable (a list or a map) and we're going to go through each of the enumerable's items and do something with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with a list. How about a list of the seasons, just for something different?
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> seasons = ["summer", "fall", "winter", "spring"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    The simplest way of enumerating through a list in Elixir is to use the <code>Enum.each</code> function. This function takes two arguments: the thing we want to enumerate through and a function to run for each of the items. Let's take a look at an example:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.each(seasons, &amp;IO.puts/1)</code></pre>

  <p>
    The first argument here is our list of seasons. The second argument is the function that we want to run for each item in this list: specifically the built-in <code>IO.puts/1</code> function. As we saw in the last chapter, <code>IO.puts/1</code> will output a string to the terminal during a program's execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at what this combination of <code>Enum.each</code>, <code>seasons</code> and <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code> does:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.each(seasons, &amp;IO.puts/1)
summer
fall
winter
spring
<span class='console-blue'>:ok</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    This particular combination of those three things has made Elixir output each season on a single line in our <code>iex</code> prompt. Then there's one more thing: that little blue <code>:ok</code> at the end of our output. This indicates to us that the iterating with <code>Enum.each/2</code> worked successfully.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <header>Try this one as a program too</header>

    <p>
      You should try running the above example as an Elixir script too. Save this file at <code>seasons.exs</code> and run it with <code>elixir seasons.exs</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you'll see will mostly be the same: all the seasons are output on their own lines. What you won't see is that final <code>:ok</code>. This is because when we run a function in the <code>iex</code> prompt, the function will always tell us what its result is.
    </p>

    <p>
      However when we get to the "big time" of running an actual program, Elixir will only generate output once we tell it to; with something such as <code>IO.puts/1</code>. This is why when you run this script you're <em>not</em> going to see <code>:ok</code>.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    Let's take a closer look at what this is doing. Specifically: what <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code> is doing. You know in Elixir that functions can take arguments and you might have in your head that those arguments could be strings, lists or maps becuase this is what we've seen done previously. But function arguments can also be other functions. This is what's happening here when we're using <code>&amp;IO.puts/1</code>. We're passing that function as an argument to <code>Enum.each/2</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get an idea of how <code>Enum.each/2</code> is able to take the <code>IO.puts/1</code> function and do something with it, we can use this code in the <code>iex</code> prompt:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> puts = &amp;IO.puts/1
puts.("summer")
"summer"
<span class='console-blue'>:ok</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>
    With this code, we've assigned the <code>IO.puts/1</code> function to a variable called <code>puts</code>. This is similar to what's going on inside the <code>Enum.each/2</code> function: whatever function we pass as the second argument will be stored with a particular name. Then <code>Enum.each/2</code> goes through each of the items and calls the provided function on it, just like we've done above.
  </p>

  <p>
    "That last line looks exactly like how we ran functions back in Chapter 5", Roberto exclaims. Yes, Roberto! That is exactly right. Back in that chapter we defined a <code>greeting</code> function like this:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> greeting = fn (place) -> "Hello, #{place}!" end
<span class='console-yellow'>#Function&lt;6.52032458/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5&gt;</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    We then made Elixir run this function using this syntax:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> greeting.("World")
<span class='console-green'>"Hello, World!"</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    What we're doing different here with our <code>puts = &amp;IO.puts/1</code> is that we're using an inbuilt function rather than constructing one of our own. We can do this with any inbuilt function we please. Here's another example, using <code>String.capitalize/1</code>:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> cap = &amp;String.capitalize/1
cap.("summer")
<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Here, the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function takes a string and turns the first letter into a capital letter. In this code example, we're making it so that we can call the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> as if it were a function called <code>cap</code>. However, if we wanted to capitalise the names of our season using the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function with <code>Enum.each/2</code> it wouldn't do very much:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.each(seasons, &amp;String.capitalize/1)
<span class='console-blue'>:ok</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Nothing is output here besides <code>:ok</code> because we're not telling Elixir to output anything. It will dutifully run the function <code>String.capitalize/1</code> for each item in the list, and then just as dutifully "forget" to tell us anything about the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we want to see what the result would be from evaluating <code>String.capitalize/1</code> for each item in the list, we're going to have to use a different function.
  </p>

  <h4>Map, but not the kind that you know already</h4>

  <p>
    The names of these seasons should be capitalized because they are nouns, but whoever created this list neglected to capitalize them. Oops! What we should have is a list with proper capitalization:
  </p>

<pre><code>["Summer", "Fall", "Winter", "Spring"]</code></pre>

  <p>
    We tried using <code>Enum.each/2</code> to give us this list of capitalized seasons, but that just told us <code>:ok</code> and it didn't give us back a list of capitalized season names.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're going to need a function that goes through each item in the list and applies <code>String.capitalize/1</code>, and then shows us the result of each application of that function. Something that would turn our existing <code>seasons</code> list into a list like this one:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> seasons = [
    String.capitalize("summer"),
    String.capitalize("fall"),
    String.capitalize("winter"),
    String.capitalize("spring"),
  ]
  [<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Fall"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Winter"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Spring"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    But since we've already got a list we're going to have to do <em>something</em> to that list to turn it into what we want. That something is to use another function from the <code>Enum</code> module called <code>Enum.map/2</code>. This <code>map</code> function is different from the map kind of data (<code>%{"name" => "Roberto"}</code>), in that the function-called-map will take the specified enumerable and another function as arguments, then enumerate through each item in the list and run that other function for each item, and then return the result of each function run.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enough jibber-jabber. Let's see this in actual practice:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> Enum.map(seasons, &amp;String.capitalize/1)
[<span class='console-green'>"Summer"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Fall"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Winter"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"Spring"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>
    Hooray! Each of our seasons now has a correctly capitalized name. What's happened here is that we've told the <code>map</code> function that we want it to run another function -- that'd be the <code>String.capitalize/1</code> function -- on each item of the <code>seasons</code> list. This is how we've been able to go from our existing list with non-capitalized season names to a new list with capitalized names.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <header>But is why is it called "map"?</header>

    <p>
      Truth be told, I didn't really give the name "map" much thought before I wrote this section of this book. I've always known it to be "map", but never really thought about why. I wanted to answer it right here, but I didn't know myself and <a href='https://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/892334810416402433'>so I asked about why it's called map on Twitter</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
     The consensus from the Twitter hivemind (nestmind? flockmind?) seems to be that this is a math-y term which gets its meaning from the cartographer map -- wherein the dimensions of the Earth are represented graphically on a map. When you resize one part of the map, you have to resize all the other parts by making the same transformation, otherwise the map no longer makes sense. I found that kind of fascinating, to be quite honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      In math, the term "map" means to take a set of numbers and then to apply the same function across them to transform them into a new set of numbers. Hey, that's like what we're doing here -- except we've got a set of words, and not numbers. We're taking a list of strings and then transforming them into a new list of strings.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <h4>BYO functions</h4>

  <p>
    One more quick example. When using <code>Enum.each/2</code> or <code>Enum.map/2</code> we don't necessarily need to pass a built-in function as the second argument. We could choose to pass our own function instead. Let's say that we had a list of numbers like this:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]</code></pre>

  <p>
    And then we wanted to multiply each number by a different number, let's say 42. We're lazy and we want the computer to do the heavy lifting, and so we can pass <code>Enum.map/2</code> a function of our own design to acheive this goal:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex&gt; Enum.map(numbers, fn (number) -&gt; number * 2 end)
[8, 16, 30, 32, 46, 84]</code></pre>

  <p>
    With our own function here, we're taking each element of the list -- represented inside the function as the variable <code>number</code> -- and then multiplying it by 42. When <code>Enum.map/2</code> has finished going through the list, it outputs a new list showing us the result of running that function on all items in the list.
  </p>

  <h4>Reducing an enumerable</h4>

  <div class='todo'>
    Cover reduce and ranges?
  </div>

  <h3>Working with maps</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we've looked at enumerating through lists and ranges, let's look at enumerating through the other kind of enumerable that we've seen: maps. We spoke a little while ago about doing so:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Similar to this, we could <em>enumerate</em> through a map. If we were to take one of our maps from earlier...
    </p>

<pre><code>%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}</code></pre>

    <p>
      ...and write each key and value pair down, they may look something like this:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt><dd>Roberto</dd>
      <dt><strong>Age</strong></dt><dd>30ish</dd>
      <dt><strong>Gender</strong></dt><dd>Male</dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To enumerate through each item in the map we can use the same function as when we were enumerating through each item in a list: <code>Enum.each/2</code>. Here's an example:
  </p>

<pre><code>iex> person = %{"name" => "Roberto", "age" => "30ish", "gender" => "Male"}
%{<span class='console-green'>"name"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Roberto"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"age"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"30ish"</span>, <span class='console-green'>"gender"</span> => <span class='console-green'>"Male"</span>}
iex> Enum.each(person, fn ({k, v}) -> IO.puts v end)
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Before I can go any further, Roberto interrupts. "Hey, those curly braces are weird! It looks like a map but it's not a map. And it's not a list because the curliness of the brackets. So what is it?"
  </p>



  * Explain enumerating through maps here, showing that kv pairs are returned as tuples.
  * Explain what tuples are and how they differ from lists. (iirc, tuples are not enumerable)
